- Perform basic book management  

This project is a foundation for learning and **requires further development** to include advanced features such as user authentication, book search, borrowing/returning functionality, and database integration.  

Features  
- Minimal and easy-to-understand code  
- Great starting point for Python projects  
- Focus on core Python concepts
